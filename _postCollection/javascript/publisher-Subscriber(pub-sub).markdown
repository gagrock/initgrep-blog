Publisher Subscriber pattern is the loosely coupled extension of [Observer pattern](/posts/javascript/observer-pattern) . It introduces a message broker or Event Bus which acts as a bridge between a publisher(Subject) and various Subscribers. The topics are published by Subject for different kinds of events. The subscriber registers for the respective topics to get notified.
