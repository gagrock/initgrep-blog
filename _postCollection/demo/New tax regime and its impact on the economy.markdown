 If you want to be part of the club, you gotta be insecure and unstable in some way. I’m not a fan.”

This corner of the internet “promote(s) isolation or negative feelings,” Erin Tatum wrote for Everyday Feminism in 2013. “[It] basically transforms taboo emotions like self-doubt into an aesthetic. Feelings of worthlessness or disillusionment become synonymous with and indicative of true tortured beauty, as well as intelligence and particularly psychological depth.” Why did Tumblr become the perfect place for online angst?
How Tumblr Became Depressed

Tumblr launched in 2007 as a blog-meets-social-network. And unlike on a typical blog, where you’re an unknown URL floating in cyberspace, Tumblr’s structure encourages community via features it pioneered, like resharing posts and direct messaging.

Tumblr users maintain a range of content types and communities — humor that excites and impacts the internet; thriving fandom communities; role-playing universes that exist entirely within the platform; subcultures around food, sex, fitness, and art; and a strong emphasis on social justice. Tumblr was one of the earliest places where activists rallied the internet’s attention.

Since Tumblr’s peak period (which seemed to curb around the time of its 2013 acquisition by Yahoo), its growth has slowed while Instagram and Snapchat have exploded. But unlike these two networks, which some see as vessels for cherry-picking and highlighting the best parts of your life, Tumblr has always felt like a comfortable place to be honest, weird, and maybe even depressed. (It’s also worth noting that Tumblr’s most popular hours differ dramatically from those of other social networks: Weekday afternoons are when Facebook and Twitter are buzzing — but Tumblr gets going late at night, especially on Fridays.)
