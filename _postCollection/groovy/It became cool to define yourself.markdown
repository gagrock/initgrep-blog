Then there’s a picture of her, the girl (at least, supposedly) behind the Tumblr: pale, with brown hair. Beautiful. She’s cool in a way that isn’t like girls at school, but that’s been in books and movies: the sad, beautiful girl who reads The Catcher in the Rye and listens to the Smiths. She receives anonymous messages asking about her life and complimenting her, and notes from people who seem to be her friends.

This part of Tumblr is familiar to 19-year-old Gillian Andrews. She, like many other teens on the blogging website, has experienced mental illness.

This corner of the internet “promote(s) isolation or negative feelings,” Erin Tatum wrote for Everyday Feminism in 2013. “[It] basically transforms taboo emotions like self-doubt into an aesthetic. Feelings of worthlessness or disillusionment become synonymous with and indicative of true tortured beauty, as well as intelligence and particularly psychological depth.” Why did Tumblr become the perfect place for online angst?
How Tumblr Became Depressed



“For me, Tumblr was a place I thought people could find themselves, especially if you’re an outsider in some kind of way,” said Leijon. While he is right that Tumblr can be a positive place for teens to explore their identities, Whitlock said the problem is that it’s like a group-therapy session with no therapist. Here, young, depressed people are hearing things only from other young, depressed people.

>“Sometimes hearing other people’s stories for why they did the same thing you did can be just, like, ‘Yeah, yeah,
