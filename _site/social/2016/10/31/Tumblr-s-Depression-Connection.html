<blockquote>
  <p>Scrolling through y0ung-blood, a wildly popular Tumblr, eventually you’ll see a picture of a daisy strung &gt;along a wall. Underneath it, there’s a message.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then there’s a picture of her, the girl (at least, supposedly) behind the Tumblr: pale, with brown hair. Beautiful. She’s cool in a way that isn’t like girls at school, but that’s been in books and movies: the sad, beautiful girl who reads The Catcher in the Rye and listens to the Smiths. She receives anonymous messages asking about her life and complimenting her, and notes from people who seem to be her friends.</p>

<p>This part of Tumblr is familiar to 19-year-old Gillian Andrews. She, like many other teens on the blogging website, has experienced mental illness.</p>

<p>The California native felt unable to talk about her self-harm, depression, and anxiety with her family and didn’t have many friends when she began using Tumblr at 14. But here, she quickly realized, her mental illness was not merely accepted — it was encouraged.</p>

<p>“It became cool to define yourself by mental illness [on Tumblr],” Andrews said. “Like, in order to be interesting or valid, you had to have some kind of it.”</p>

<p>An entire Tumblr community has formed around embracing depression and anxiety. While pockets of this community are supportive and helpful for users, Janis Whitlock, a Cornell University researcher who studies how teens process mental illness using social media, said certain subsets of the blogging website can be a “cauldron of unhappiness.”</p>

<p>This Tumblr subculture began to flourish in 2013, according to a flurry of thinkpieces. It developed from an aesthetic called “soft grunge,” which paired beauty and intelligence with a loner aesthetic. Posts are marked by pop culture mainstays like Skins, Lana Del Rey, and Marina and the Diamonds, who are sort of like the community’s antiheroes. Sometimes, you find refuge in a place that accepts your sadness — but other times, the constant rumination and idolization of certain images, quotes, and celebs is just negative reinforcement.</p>

<p>“This is exactly the kind of romanticizing I think that a huge part of Tumblr is doing,” explained Swedish film student Hampus Leijon, 22, who started using the site at 16, while experiencing depression. “Just making it seem like — depression, suicide, this is cool. If you want to be part of the club, you gotta be insecure and unstable in some way. I’m not a fan.”</p>

<p>This corner of the internet “promote(s) isolation or negative feelings,” Erin Tatum wrote for Everyday Feminism in 2013. “[It] basically transforms taboo emotions like self-doubt into an aesthetic. Feelings of worthlessness or disillusionment become synonymous with and indicative of true tortured beauty, as well as intelligence and particularly psychological depth.” Why did Tumblr become the perfect place for online angst?
How Tumblr Became Depressed</p>

<p>Tumblr launched in 2007 as a blog-meets-social-network. And unlike on a typical blog, where you’re an unknown URL floating in cyberspace, Tumblr’s structure encourages community via features it pioneered, like resharing posts and direct messaging.</p>

<p>Tumblr users maintain a range of content types and communities — humor that excites and impacts the internet; thriving fandom communities; role-playing universes that exist entirely within the platform; subcultures around food, sex, fitness, and art; and a strong emphasis on social justice. Tumblr was one of the earliest places where activists rallied the internet’s attention.</p>

<p>Since Tumblr’s peak period (which seemed to curb around the time of its 2013 acquisition by Yahoo), its growth has slowed while Instagram and Snapchat have exploded. But unlike these two networks, which some see as vessels for cherry-picking and highlighting the best parts of your life, Tumblr has always felt like a comfortable place to be honest, weird, and maybe even depressed. (It’s also worth noting that Tumblr’s most popular hours differ dramatically from those of other social networks: Weekday afternoons are when Facebook and Twitter are buzzing — but Tumblr gets going late at night, especially on Fridays.)

<p>This is, in part, assisted by anonymity (something Facebook flat-out fights) — there’s no standard of attaching a name to your account or way to look at who others are following. Not even Twitter and Instagram can do that. Reddit, which also offers complete anonymity, has also become a popular gathering place for those with mental illness. It’s even been a space for incredibly effective support groups. Clearly, internet anonymity can have its benefits.</p>

<p>Whitlock, the Cornell research scientist, said the most important component of an internet community like this is the anonymity. “People don’t feel comfortable heading to school with signs saying ‘I self-injure, come talk to me.’ The internet allows people to shrug off the geographic boundaries that have always been there to mask themselves and hide who they are.”</p>

<p>There’s a reason that these sorts of groups haven’t as obviously manifested on Facebook and Twitter; mental illness is often seen as a taboo that few young people want to attach themselves to. Furthermore, Tumblr’s user base leans female and young, according to the Pew Research Center. Those are the two demographics most susceptible to depression and anxiety. Julie Garcia, a therapist based in Northern California, told me over the phone that teens and adults often base their self-esteem on social media. It can even exacerbate the symptoms of those who already have mental illness. “They’re making social media a place where they become vulnerable, and they don’t always get positive feedback,” said Garcia, who has worked in three different high schools in addition to treating teens in her private practice.</p>

<p><em>“I was more open about my weird issues [on Tumblr],” Andrews said. “I could talk more openly to a group of strangers than I could to people I had to face every day and, I think, worry about me.” Quickly browsing Tumblr will prove Andrews is hardly alone: There are countless anonymous, confessional blogs discussing topics like eating disorders and self-harm. Some of those posts have hundreds of thousands of interactions. Sustained feelings of loneliness, unhappiness, and other potential symptoms of mental illness can be a common friendship base for those who are struggling, Garcia said. “They are connecting and they get each other. It’s comfortable if you’re both depressed.”</em></p>

<p>“For me, Tumblr was a place I thought people could find themselves, especially if you’re an outsider in some kind of way,” said Leijon. While he is right that Tumblr can be a positive place for teens to explore their identities, Whitlock said the problem is that it’s like a group-therapy session with no therapist. Here, young, depressed people are hearing things only from other young, depressed people.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Sometimes hearing other people’s stories for why they did the same thing you did can be just, like, ‘Yeah, yeah,</p>
