Tumblr launched in 2007 as a blog-meets-social-network. And unlike on a typical blog, where you’re an unknown URL floating in cyberspace, Tumblr’s structure encourages community via features it pioneered, like resharing posts and direct messaging.

Tumblr users maintain a range of content types and communities — humor that excites and impacts the internet; thriving fandom communities; role-playing universes that exist entirely within the platform; subcultures around food, sex, fitness, and art; and a strong emphasis on social justice. Tumblr was one of the earliest places where activists rallied the internet’s attention.

Since Tumblr’s peak period (which seemed to curb around the time of its 2013 acquisition by Yahoo), its growth has slowed while Instagram and Snapchat have exploded. But unlike these two networks, which some see as vessels for cherry-picking and highlighting the best parts of your life, Tumblr has always felt like a comfortable place to be honest, weird, and maybe even depressed. (It’s also worth noting that Tumblr’s most popular hours differ dramatically from those of other social networks: Weekday afternoons are when Facebook and Twitter are buzzing — but Tumblr gets going late at night, especially on Fridays.)

This is, in part, assisted by anonymity (something Facebook flat-out fights) — there’s no standard of attaching a name to your account or way to look at who others are following. Not even Twitter and Instagram can do that. Reddit, which also offers complete anonymity, has also become a popular gathering place for those with mental illness. It’s even been a space for incredibly effective support groups. Clearly, internet anonymity can have its benefits.

Whitlock, the Cornell research scientist, said the most important component of an internet community like this is the anonymity. “People don’t feel comfortable heading to school with signs saying ‘I self-injure, come talk to me.’ The internet allows people to shrug off the geographic boundaries that have always been there to mask themselves and hide who they are.”

There’s a reason that these sorts of groups haven’t as obviously manifested on Facebook and Twitter; mental illness is often seen as a taboo that few young people want to attach themselves to. Furthermore, Tumblr’s user base leans female and young, according to the Pew Research Center. Those are the two demographics most susceptible to depression and anxiety. Julie Garcia, a therapist based in Northern California, told me over the phone that teens and adults often base their self-esteem on social media. It can even exacerbate the symptoms of those who already have mental illness. “They’re making social media a place where they become vulnerable, and they don’t always get positive feedback,” said Garcia, who has worked in three different high schools in addition to treating teens in her private practice.

_“I was more open about my weird issues [on Tumblr],” Andrews said. “I could talk more openly to a group of strangers than I could to people I had to face every day and, I think, worry about me.” Quickly browsing Tumblr will prove Andrews is hardly alone: There are countless anonymous, confessional blogs discussing topics like eating disorders and self-harm. Some of those posts have hundreds of thousands of interactions. Sustained feelings of loneliness, unhappiness, and other potential symptoms of mental illness can be a common friendship base for those who are struggling, Garcia said. “They are connecting and they get each other. It’s comfortable if you’re both depressed.”_

“For me, Tumblr was a place I thought people could find themselves, especially if you’re an outsider in some kind of way,” said Leijon. While he is right that Tumblr can be a positive place for teens to explore their identities, Whitlock said the problem is that it’s like a group-therapy session with no therapist. Here, young, depressed people are hearing things only from other young, depressed people.
