###jekyll based blog

Hi, I have developed this template and it has grown ever since. 
I wanted to develop everything using liquid templates and avoiding all the other plugins.

Incase you are looking for a template, You are free to copy it except the pages I have written.
They belong to me.

I would however advice you to start developing your own site. you can visit  [shayksLog][www.shaykhslog.com] to know more about the steps I used to develop this blog.

Thank you for dropping by..
