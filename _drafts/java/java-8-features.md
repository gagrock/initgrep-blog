#### Lambda expression.

Lambda expressions were introduced as a move towards functional programming. Java has traditionally bean an object oriented language. While it serves the purpose for most of the use-cases, functional programming has its own advantages such as lazy evaluation, Memoization etc.

Lambda expression takes over the anonymous class approach and replaces it with a function style approach. It encapsulates a single unit of behavior and passes it to other code. 

The last statement is kinda confusing, I know -- I been through it. Let us take a step back and split the below part of statement. 
`It encapsulates a single unit of behavior and passes it to other code.`

`A single unit of behavior` in its simple terms means a unit of code, ideally a type, which only performs one function. This function is predictable by its type and it does not change. For example, an interface with a  single method -- Functional Interface.
